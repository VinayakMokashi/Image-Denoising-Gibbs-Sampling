# image-denoising-gibbs-sampling
Image denoising using Gibbs Sampling (MCMC) to restore noisy images by leveraging a Markov Random Field model. This project minimizes noise through probabilistic inference, using energy functions to enhance image clarity and stability. Ideal for those exploring MCMC in image processing.
